# Portfolio

## About

I wanted a quick turnaround project to work on and display digitally. This also allows me to further develop my skills in front-end, back-end and deployment.

Good thing I was able to find the domain I wanted.

## To-do

- [x] Deploy first version
- [x] Rebuild using React & Gatsby
- [x] Redeploy
- [ ] Finish working on redesign (extended version) of portfolio

## Features

Utilizes: `Modern UI & Animations`, `Bootstrap v4.3`, `SCSS`, `CSS3`, `Webpack`, `React`, `Gatsby`

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

For further in-depth instructions related to structure, see [Simplefolio-Gatsby](https://github.com/cobidev/gatsby-simplefolio)

### Prerequisites

Download [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [NPM](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. Also install [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/)

```
node@v10.16.0 or higher
npm@6.9.0 or higher
git@2.17.1 or higher
gatsby-cli@2.8.22 or higher
```

Also, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead of NPM

```
yarn@v1.21.1 or higher
```

## How To Use

From your command line, first clone Simplefolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/cobidev/gatsby-simplefolio

# Go into the repository
$ cd gatsby-simplefolio

# Remove current origin repository
$ git remote remove origin
```

Then you can install the dependencies either using NPM or Yarn:

Using NPM:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Start development server
$ npm run develop
```

Using Yarn:

```bash
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Start development server
$ yarn develop
```

**NOTE**:
If your run into issues installing the dependencies with NPM, use this command:

```bash
# Install dependencies with all permissions
$ sudo npm install --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root
```

Once your server has started, go to this url `http://localhost:8080/` and you will see the website running on a Development Server:
